# Impurity Matrix Parser App
A jupyter notebook based app to parse and process Thermo impurity matrices.

## How to use it
1) Open a Thermo reporter isotope impurity datasheet.
2) Select entries from the impurity matrix, not including the headers, and copy the content to the clipboard.
3) Open the Jupyter notebook on Binder and run all cells.
4) Paste the content of the clipboard into the text input field and press the "Process matrix" button.
5) Click the blue buttons to download the impurity table and the impurity matrix in diagonal format.

> **Note**
> We provide [example datasheets](https://github.com/hollenstein/impurity_matrix_parser_app/tree/main/example_datasheets) for different plexes.
> In order to copy text from any of the PDF files you first need to download them.
